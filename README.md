## Abstract

The Jupyter ecosystem is a powerful platform for exploratory computational science, and now it can connect with some of the deep and rich domain-specific desktop applications that have decades of feature development already invested in them. With the integration of 3D Slicer and Jupyter through the xeus-python’s interpreter, we demonstrate how a Qt-based graphical desktop application can be used through a Jupyter notebook with 3D visualization provided by Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and image processing provided by the Insight Toolkit (ITK). This approach is available on the SlicerJupyter GitHub repository and could be extended to other applications that embed Python, such as Blender, FreeCAD, or ParaView.
